The MaxInlineSize affects compilations of methods executed at least one time but less than MinInliningThreshold
times only. For methods executed more than MinInliningThreshold there is a different setting -XX:FreqInlineSize=…
having a far bigger (platform dependent) default value. Hotspots are still inlined regardless of the MaxInlineSize.
You may test it by running an application with -XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:+PrintInlining -XX:MaxInlineSize=0.
It will still report inlining of hot spots (these with the comment “(hot)”). Only methods formerly reported as
inlined with the comment “executed < MinInliningThreshold times” might then get the comment to “too big”.
If you set down the FreqInlineSize you might receive comments like “hot method too big”.
